# MUI X Tree View

<p class="description">The Tree View lets users navigate hierarchical lists of data with nested levels that can be expanded and collapsed.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Overview

The MUI X Tree View provides all of the functionality necessary to build a hierarchical list of expandable and collapsible items.

The demo below shows how to render a Simple Tree View—try clicking on an item to see how it expands and collapses:

## Using this documentation

Although the Simple and Rich Tree View share many of the same features, each version's implementation of those features differs enough that they warrant their own separate docs in most cases.
Other features, such as accessibility, work the same in both versions and are documented in the main features section of the navigation bar.
